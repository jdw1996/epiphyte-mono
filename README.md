# Epiphyte Mono

The Epiphyte Mono font is a clear, easy-to-read font primarily intended for
writing code.  It is based on the
[Liberation Mono](https://pagure.io/liberation-fonts) font and so is metrically
compatible with Courier New.

While GitHub identifies this repository as hosting
[Brainf***](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) code, the `*.bf` files are
actually generated by the [BirdFont](https://birdfont.org/) font editor, and
contain font information.
