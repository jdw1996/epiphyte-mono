The Epiphyte Mono font is a clear, easy-to-read font primarily intended for
writing code.  It is based on the
[Liberation Mono](https://pagure.io/liberation-fonts) font and so is metrically
compatible with Courier New.  You can find the TTF files to install on your
computer in the `fonts/` directory, or you can download them in a Zip archive
[here](https://github.com/jdw1996/epiphyte-mono/releases/download/v1.0/epiphyte-mono.zip).

This is my first foray into font design, and it would not be possible if not
for the [BirdFont](https://birdfont.org/) font editor and all the work that
others have put into [Liberation Mono](https://pagure.io/liberation-fonts).

*Please note that while GitHub identifies this repository as hosting
[Brainf***](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) code, the `*.bf` files in the
`src/` directory are actually generated by the
[BirdFont](https://birdfont.org/) font editor, and contain font information.*
